Hi, I'm Fati — a Software Engineering and Business Informatics student based in Berlin.
I’m passionate about building practical solutions with modern web technologies and AI tools.

What I work on:

Full-stack development (JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Next.js)

Backend & APIs (Node.js, Python, Supabase, PostgreSQL)

Automation & AI (Make.com, n8n, LLM integrations)

Data & process modeling (BPMN, ERP concepts)

I enjoy learning new technologies, solving real problems, and turning ideas into usable software.
Currently looking for opportunities to contribute to open-source and grow as a developer.
